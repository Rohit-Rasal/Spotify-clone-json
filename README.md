# 🎧 Spotify Clone

This is my first JavaScript project—a **Spotify Clone** that mimics the basic functionalities of the popular music streaming service. It fetches songs from a JSON file, displays them on the website,
and is fully responsive for different screen sizes.

- **No Backend**: The app fetches songs using a JSON file, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.
- **Fully Responsive**: Designed to provide a seamless user experience across devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Custom Audio Controls**: Includes play, pause, next, and previous buttons to control music playback.
- **SVG Icons**: Enhanced with custom SVG icons for various controls.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Features a hamburger menu for easy access to different sections of the app.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language used for structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: Stylesheet language used for designing the layout and appearance of the app.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Programming language used for adding interactivity and handling data.
- **JSON**: Used for storing and fetching the song data.
- **SVG**: Scalable Vector Graphics used for custom icons.

This Spotify Clone is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on any device.
